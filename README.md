# ESP32_NVS_Manager
 Manage ESP32 NVS parameters via USB Serial without reflashing. Features a schema-driven architecture where the ESP32 defines validation rules (types, min/max) and a Python GUI dynamically builds the UI for real-time updates. Ideal for tuning GPIOs and timeouts. Includes RGB (WS2812) and Simple LED examples for rapid prototyping.
